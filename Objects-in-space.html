                <p>Space is full of stuff... well, kind of. As already mentioned it is 
                    mostly empty space, but if you add it up there is a lot of stuff. 
                    To be exact: Stars, Dust and other solid objects.

                    There are different kinds of Stars like brown dwarfs, red dwarfs, 
                    neutron stars, normal Stars, red giants and after they die, sometimes 
                    they explode and become black holes. These explosions are called 
                    supernovas and they create a lot of Dust from which new planets and 
                    asteroids arise.

                    Probably the most well known Star is our sun. It is the 
                    only star that provides energy to intelligent life. At least as far as 
                    we know.It has nine Planets circeling it, one of which is earth.
