                    Even though it's hard and expensive to get to space, humanity 
                    was able to do it. And we haven't stopped. Each year 
                    there are still tens of satellites put into low earth orbit. 
                    And this this number will only get higher. 
                    Elon Musk is planning to send 60,000 Satellites in low orbit 
                    which will bring an internet connection to everyone. 
                    But the problem with that is that the probability of two 
                    satellites colliding will rise exponetial.

                    When two Satellites collide with each other they shatter. 
                    Parts of shattered Satellites are calles Space Debris. 
                    Space Debris can be categorised as following.

                    The first satellite was put in orbit in 1957. Since then 
                    the first human on the moon in 1969 and the first space station 
                    in 1971. Actually some of the people that went on the moon
                    left some cool stuff on there too. For example a reflector to 
                    messure the distance to earth, a car they used to drive around
                    and some bags of poop.
