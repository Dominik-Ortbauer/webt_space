                    Today we are fairly confident that the Milky Way is 
                    probably between 100,000 and 150,000 light years across. 
                    The observable Universe is, of course, much larger. 
                    According to current thinking it is about 93 billion 
                    light years in diameter.

                    This distance was measured using a way we use everyday, 
                    they used the same technice as we humans use to detemine 
                    distance using our two eyes. The set up two telescopes and 
                    measured the angles to the star, then they did some math 
                    and calculated the distance.
