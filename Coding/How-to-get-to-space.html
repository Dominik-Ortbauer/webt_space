                    Currently there is only one way for us humans to get to space. 
                    Using a rocket, it is good for transporting 
                    humans as well as satellites or other objects.

                    The hardest part about launching a rocket is the launch itself, 
                    because the further away from earth you get the less gravity acts. 
                    Not to says the rest is easy but after you leave earths atmoshere 
                    the greatest hurdle is done.

                    Now you can either choose to go to a planet and explore it or just 
                    wonder around in space like some satellites do.
